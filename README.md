# SportsAndSocieties

This is my final year project for Software Development. My research phase in the first semester focused on user interactions and experiences in mobile applications through the use of design patterns and HCi principles. The implementation phase is based around my findings in the research phase and mapping those findings onto an Android mobile application for CIT Sports and Societies clubs.

The aim of the project is to develop an informative and accessible application for all users. The application displays information regarding each Sports club and Society that CIT has to offer. The information in the application is stored on a cloud-hosted backend that provides real-time synchronisation across all devices.

Sports Clubs:

-Fixtures...who, where, when

-Results...who, where, when, score

-Events...description, where, when

Societies:

-Events...description, where, when

Each event in the application has a button to indicate they're interested in going to the event. This is essentially an attendance tracker that can be used to provide end of year analytics on what type of events have the biggest turnouts for a given Sports club or Society.
